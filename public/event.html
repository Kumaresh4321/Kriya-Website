                    <h5>ROUND 2: MAKE OR BREAK</h5>Turning coins into components!<p></p>
                    This round is based on the technological aspects of electricity, especially the design and application of circuitry and electronic equipment. 
                    The participants will be given one main question which will be related 
                    to building a circuit. But to build the circuit they’ll need components, to buy the components they’ll need 
                    coins and to earn the coins they need to work, i.e solve the questions. So, they'll be given a set of questions 
                    in 2 separate G-forms where each member of the team will have to attend one g-form. Later the team can 
                    use the cumulative points as coins to get the components to build their main circuit.

                    <h5>Description</h5>
                    This event is especially for Mechanical Stream Students (Mechanical, Production, Automobile, 
                    Metallurgy) and whoever has fascination towards Mechanical Stream Studies. It’s exclusively based on 
                    "Divergent Thinking". There will be three rounds. In round I, the participants will be given sets of pictures 
                    and will be asked to identify the engineering concept. These concepts will be related especially to 
                    Mechanical Stream. In Round II, the participants will be challenged with a case study of non-technical 
                    topics. The participants have only got one and half minutes to provide a suitable solution for their case. 
                    Reading and comprehending the case study is vital for solving the case. This competition gives them a 
                    chance to analyse and solve the problems. After one individual answers, the question will be passed to 
                    others. First three who raise hands in the meet will be given a chance to give solutions for the case study. 
                    Bonus points will be given to those who give feasible answers to the case. A technical problem statement 
                    from the mechanical stream will be given in round three. They must present their solutions pertaining to the 
                    case. No passing of questions will be done in this round. And each round has an elimination part. This 
                    event is a completely interactive event and we want our participants to have the best event experience ride. 
                    So, what are you waiting for? Join us now.

                    describe the answer, based on which points are split: for example if the pictures hint at a phenomenon, then 
                    the participants have to name the phenomenon and describe it. If a team does not answer their question then 
                    the question will be open for other teams to answer and a bonus mark will be rewarded for the team with the 
                    correct answer. Points will be awarded by the judge.

                    <h5>ROUND 1:</h5>
                    Students (Max two in team) are required to build a hand launch glider using any materials of their own. 
      Marks will be awarded based on the maximum time of flight. And detailed report of the glider design should 
      be submitted.<p></p>
                    
                    <h5>ROUND 2:</h5>
                    The Shortlisted students are required to attend a Q&A session with the judge and explain about their gliders design. <p></p>
                    <b>Design constrains:</b><p></p> 
      <ul> 
        <li>The wing span should be 0.3 to 1 meters and its length should not exceed 1 meter.</li> 
        <li>Students are allowed to use any kind of materials (you could use different material for different components.</li> 
        <li>The glider should include four main components (i,e wings ,fuselage ,stabilizers and nose).</li> 
        <li>The weight to time of flight ratio could also be an judging factor.</li> 
      </ul><p></p>
      <b>Launching criteria:</b><p></p> 
      The glider should be launched only by holding the fuselage. You can either launch by standing or 
      through running. The time of flight should be noted using the stop watch and recorded using camera.<p></p>
      <b>Report:</b><p></p>
      A detailed design report of the glider should be submitted, which should include dimensions, weight 
      (whole weight and components weight), justification for the choice of material, cad modelling and CFD 
      analysis (not compulsory). 
      The report of their aircraft should be no longer than 15 pages (A4 size 1.5 line spacing) with standard 
      formatting. The report must document the basic design of the aircraft (dimensions, wing areas, velocity, 
      etc.) and should also explain how their design is suitable for the given problem. 
      Along with the abstract, participants must also send a zip file containing at least 5 and no more than 10 
      photographs of the aircraft while it is being built."

                        <b>Rules and Regulations:</b><br> 
  <ul> 
    <li>The video should cover glider and the stop watch clearly.</li> 
    <li>Ready to fly gliders are strictly prohibited.</li> 
    <li>The video and the report should be presented to the judges.</li> 
    <li>It is suggested to submitted good clarity video.</li> 
  </ul><br> 
  <b>Guidelines for the video:</b><p></p>
  <ul> 
    <li>Video can be recorded with a smartphone or a camera. The person recording the video should be in a 
          safe, stationary position and should not move/ run while recording.</li> 
    <li>Recording setup: An analog watch should be placed in front of the camera while recording the video in 
          such a way that the time is visible throughout the recording. It is recommended to build a small device to 
          hold the camera and watch in position to achieve this. Please ensure the watch does not take up more than 
          20% of the screen space.</li> 
    <li>The video recording should be done without any break in between.<p></p> 
    <b>Dimensions</b>: A 1m scale (which is available in the stores) should be used to measure the wingspan of the glider.
    In this part, the dimensions of the glider must be measured and clearly visible in the video. This should not exceed 1 min duration.<p></p>
    <b>Launch</b>: The glider should be launched by releasing it from the hand.<p></p></li> 
    <li>Both the glider and the watch should be visible throughout the video – right from the beginning to the landing.</li> 
    <li>No editing should be done to the audio or video. Name of participants, college etc. should be added in the description of the video when uploading.</li> 
    <li>Each team can submit only one video for the competition.</li>
